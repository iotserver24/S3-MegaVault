# Security Overview

This document outlines the security architecture and best practices for MegaVault Open Source, a single-user cloud storage platform.

## Security Architecture

MegaVault implements a **defense-in-depth** security strategy with multiple layers of protection:

### 1. Authentication Layer
- **Single-User Authentication**: Environment variable-based credentials (`USER_EMAIL`, `USER_PASSWORD`)
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with configurable expiration (30 days default)
- **NextAuth.js Integration**: Industry-standard authentication framework
- **No Database Dependencies**: Reduces attack surface by eliminating user lookup queries

### 2. API Security
- **Session Validation**: All protected endpoints verify JWT tokens
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing
- **Error Masking**: Generic error messages prevent information disclosure
- **Input Validation**: File type and size validation on uploads

### 3. Storage Security
- **S3-Compatible Storage**: Secure file storage with signed URLs
- **User Isolation**: Files organized by unique folder IDs
- **Content-Type Preservation**: MIME type validation and preservation
- **Access Control**: Private files require authentication

### 4. Environment Security
- **Secret Management**: All secrets stored in environment variables
- **Configuration Validation**: Startup validation prevents insecure configurations
- **Default Value Detection**: Prevents deployment with default/example values

## Security Principles

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Single-user design eliminates multi-user privilege escalation risks
- API endpoints have minimal required permissions
- Storage access limited to user's designated folder

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
- Application, storage, and transport security combined
- No single point of failure for security

### Security by Design
- Security considerations built into core architecture
- Environment-based configuration prevents credential exposure
- Stateless authentication reduces session-based vulnerabilities

## Threat Model

### In Scope Threats
1. **Unauthorized Access**: Malicious actors attempting to access files or admin functions
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Attempts to steal stored files or user data
3. **Configuration Attacks**: Exploitation of insecure configurations
4. **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, XSS, and other injection-based attacks
5. **Man-in-the-Middle**: Network-based interception attacks

### Out of Scope
- Physical security of hosting infrastructure
- Insider threats with legitimate access credentials
- Advanced persistent threats requiring extensive resources
- Social engineering attacks targeting the user directly

## Security Assumptions

- **Trusted Environment**: Server environment is trusted and properly secured
- **Secure Communications**: HTTPS/TLS properly configured for production
- **Updated Dependencies**: System administrators maintain updated software
- **Proper Configuration**: Environment variables configured according to guidelines

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Default Credentials**: Using example/default passwords in production
- **HTTP in Production**: Unencrypted communications in production environments
- **Exposed Services**: Redis or storage services accessible from internet
- **Weak Secrets**: Short or predictable JWT secrets

### Medium Risk Items
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Known vulnerabilities in third-party packages
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: Potential for brute force attacks
- **Insufficient Logging**: Limited visibility into security events
- **Single Point of Failure**: No redundancy for critical services

### Low Risk Items
- **Development Exposure**: Development configurations in non-production environments
- **Client-Side Validation**: Reliance on frontend validation (mitigated by backend validation)

## Security Controls

### Preventive Controls
- Environment variable validation
- Input sanitization and validation  
- Authentication and authorization checks
- CORS and security headers
- File type and size restrictions

### Detective Controls
- Error logging and monitoring
- Access logging
- Configuration validation warnings
- Startup security checks

### Corrective Controls
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Session invalidation on security events
- Configuration reset procedures
- Incident response procedures

## Compliance Considerations

While MegaVault is designed for personal use, it implements several best practices that align with security frameworks:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web application vulnerabilities
- **Data Protection**: User data isolation and secure storage
- **Access Control**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Audit Trail**: Logging of security-relevant events

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual file access patterns
- Configuration change events
- Error rates and types
- Storage access patterns

### Recommended Monitoring Setup
- Application logs centralized and monitored
- Redis connection monitoring
- Storage service access logs
- Network traffic analysis
- System resource monitoring

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Categories
1. **Authentication Breach**: Unauthorized access to admin credentials
2. **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to stored files
3. **Service Disruption**: DoS attacks or service failures
4. **Configuration Compromise**: Unauthorized configuration changes

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems and revoke compromised credentials
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of security incident
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage and restore secure state
4. **Recovery**: Restore services and implement additional safeguards
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document incident and improve security measures

## Regular Security Maintenance
