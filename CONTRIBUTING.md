   flutter run
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier for code formatting
- **Comments**: Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- **Security**: Follow security best practices

### Git Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with detailed description

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of the change (optional)

Fixes #123
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

### Pull Request Process
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Follow the PR template
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Address feedback promptly

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Web application tests
npm run test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage

# Mobile application tests
cd megavault_mobile
flutter test
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for new functions and components
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Maintain good test coverage

### Test Structure
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Component/Function Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should handle normal case', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle edge case', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle error case', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## üì± Mobile App Development

The Flutter mobile app is a high-priority area needing contributions.

### Current Status
