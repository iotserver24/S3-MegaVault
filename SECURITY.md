## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**For sensitive security issues:**
- Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue
- Email security issues privately to the maintainers
- Include detailed information about the vulnerability
- We will respond within 48 hours

**For general security improvements:**
- Create a GitHub issue with the `security` label
- Provide clear steps to reproduce if applicable
- Suggest potential fixes or mitigations

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
4. **Environment**: Operating system, browser, versions
5. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if safe to share)
6. **Suggested Fix**: Potential mitigation or fix (if known)

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

**Environment Security:**
- Change all default passwords and secrets immediately
- Use strong, unique passwords (20+ characters)
- Generate cryptographically secure JWT secrets (64+ characters)
- Enable HTTPS in production environments
- Secure Redis and storage service access

**Network Security:**
- Configure firewalls to restrict access
- Use VPN or private networks for service communication
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security updates and monitoring

**Operational Security:**
- Regular backups with secure storage
- Monitor authentication logs for anomalies
- Implement incident response procedures
- Regular security assessments

### For Developers

**Code Security:**
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
- Implement proper error handling
- Regular dependency updates and security audits

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure authentication flows
- Validate permissions on all protected endpoints
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Security Features

MegaVault includes several built-in security features:

### Authentication Security
- Single-user authentication reduces attack surface
- Environment-based credential storage
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Configurable session timeouts
- No database queries for user lookup

### API Security
- Session validation on protected endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error message sanitization
- Proper HTTP status codes

### Storage Security
- S3-compatible storage with signed URLs
- User folder isolation
- File type validation
- Secure file access controls

### Configuration Security
- Environment variable validation
- Default value detection and warnings
- Security configuration checks
- Production security warnings

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- No built-in rate limiting (implement at reverse proxy level)
- No built-in two-factor authentication (planned for future)
- Single-user design limits some enterprise security features

### Recommended Additional Security
- Implement rate limiting with Nginx or similar
- Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Regular security assessments
- Backup and disaster recovery planning

## Security Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update security-critical dependencies:

- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication framework
- **AWS SDK**: Storage service integration
- **Redis clients**: Database connectivity
- **React & Next.js**: Frontend framework
- **Node.js runtime**: Server environment

## Security Updates

### Update Process
1. Security vulnerabilities are assessed for impact
2. Fixes are developed and tested
3. Security updates are released promptly
4. Users are notified of critical updates
5. Documentation is updated with security guidance

### Notification Channels
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with security information
- Documentation updates
- Community announcements

## Compliance and Standards

MegaVault follows security best practices aligned with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Secure Development Lifecycle**: Security built into development process
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
