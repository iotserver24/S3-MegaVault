## üìù Summary

The MegaVault platform has been successfully transformed from a commercial SaaS application to a self-hosted, open source cloud storage solution. All commercial features (billing, subscriptions, payment processing) have been removed, and the system now operates with:

- **Environment-based configuration**: All settings controlled via environment variables
- **Simplified user management**: Admin access via environment, users managed through simple interface
- **Open source architecture**: Clean, documented codebase ready for community contributions
- **Docker deployment**: Ready-to-use Docker configuration for easy deployment
- **Modern tech stack**: Next.js, React, Flutter, Redis, S3-compatible storage

The transformation maintains all core functionality while removing commercial dependencies and making the system suitable for self-hosting and open source distribution.

## ‚úÖ Final Status: COMPLETE

The open source transformation has been completed successfully. The system is ready for:
1. Open source release
2. Community contributions  
3. Self-hosted deployments
4. Docker-based installations
5. Production use
